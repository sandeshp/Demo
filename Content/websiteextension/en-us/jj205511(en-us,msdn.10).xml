					Web Sites handles allocating, tuning, and managing hardware resources required for a web site so you can focus on developing the web site you want with tools of your choice. Web Sites will even build and deploy a web site of your choice from one of several web site templates provided by the web site gallery. After you have created a web site in Web Sites you can manage web site performance and the web site’s access to other Web Sites resources.</p>

						Web Sites allows you to quickly increase a web site’s performance and fault tolerance by configuring the web site to run in dedicated (<strong>reserved</strong>) mode and/or by configuring the web site with multiple runtime instances. You can evaluate a summary of your web site’s performance from the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab or configure and view detailed web site performance metrics from the <strong>Monitor</strong> tab.</p>

          <p>If your web site requires access to a relational database you can create a SQL Server database instance and link it to your web site. If you create a template based web site that requires access to a MySQL database, the database will be created and linked to the web site when the web site is being created.</p>
