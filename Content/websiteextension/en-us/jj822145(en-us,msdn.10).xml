        <p>Click the <strong>Manage Domains</strong> icon at the bottom of web site management pages to display the <strong>Manage Custom Domains</strong> dialog box. You can then add 1 or more fully qualified domain names (FQDN) to be associated with your web site. Please check with your provider and domain name issuer in regards to setting up your DNS records to insure your domain name resolves properly to this web site.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Subscription Support</strong> - Depending on the plan your website is provisioned against, you may have the ability to add custom domain names to your website. Please check your plan to determine if your web site is eligible for custom domain management. If the <strong>Manage Domains</strong> command is greyed out in the command bar then your website is not eligible for custom domain support in its current Scale mode. Sometimes scaling your website from <strong>Intro Shared</strong> to <strong>Basic Shared</strong> or <strong>Reserved</strong> from the web siteâ€™s <strong>Scale</strong> management page will provide access to this feature.</p>
