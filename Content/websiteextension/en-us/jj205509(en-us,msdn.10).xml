        <p>All of the information required to publish a web application to a Web Site for each enabled publication method is stored in an XML file known as a <em>publish profile</em>. The publish profile contains the URLs, user credentials and database strings required to connect to and authenticate against each of the endpoints for which a publication method is enabled. Though a publish profile uses the XML file format it is saved with the extension “.PublishSettings”. A publish profile can be manually opened and examined using Notepad or Internet Explorer. Microsoft WebMatrix supports reading publish profiles to automate publishing web applications to web sites.</p>
