        <p>Several commands are displayed at the bottom of the Web Site management pages. Use the <strong>Start</strong> or <strong>Stop</strong> icon to start or stop a web site.</p>
        <div id="sectionSection0" class="section">
          <p>When you stop a web site it stops accepting incoming requests but does continue processing any outstanding requests. After all outstanding requests have been satisfied the web siteâ€™s hosting process is terminated. When a web site is started the hosting process is not actually started until an incoming client request is received.</p>
